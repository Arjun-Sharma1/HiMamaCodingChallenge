# HiMama Coding Challenge

I have included all the required modules and files in the project so you should
be able to run it by opening index.html.

If for some reason it is missing a module, then go to command line and do an npm 
install in this directory. 

Technology Used: Backbone.js, jQuery, HTML, CSS

Note: It seems that some of Backbones features don't work in Internet Explorer
 but the application works on most other browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera).
